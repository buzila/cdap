/**
 * <p>This cache allows to reuse objects that are created on executor side and have high initialization. By default
 * spark deserializes new task for each partition, so if a single executor processes a lot of partitions it performs
 * a lot of unnecesary work initializing all the plugins for every partition. This cache solves the problem.</p>
 * <p>It works in the next fashion:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Within a driver one creates a factory that can make cache instance.</li>
 *  <li>A separate cache instance must be created by for each value one wants to cache by calling 
 *  {@link Factory#newCache()}. Each cache internally gets an unique id that would later be used to find objects in 
 *  cache.</li>
 *  <li>The cache can now be serialized and sent over to executors</li>
 *  <li>When one needs to get a value it calls {@link #getValue} passing loader.</li>
 *  <li>During first call for a thread a loader is invoked and must create the value to be used later</li>
 *  <li>If the value was already created for the current thread it's returned without invoking a loader</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>Note that values are reused only within a single thread. This ensures such caching won't provoke any concurrency
 * issues. It also works good with spark since it uses thread pool to run tasks.
 * </p>
 * <p>Also all values are stored as weak references. It ensures that if value is not used anymore and there is 
 * memory pressure it will be garbage collected.
 * </p>
 * <p>Important: One must not reuse caches for different values! New instance of cache must be created for each value
 * </p>
